# Multi-Agent Pathfinding (Search Algorithms)

Problem Statement:

You are tasked with creating a Multi-Agent Pathfinding AI for a warehouse environment.

Multiple agents (robots) need to navigate a grid-like warehouse to reach their target destinations

without collisions.

Requirements:

1\. Implement A\* or Dijkstra's Algorithm for optimal pathfinding for individual agents.

2\. Use Cooperative Pathfinding to handle multiple agents simultaneously.

3\. Ensure agents avoid collisions in both time and space.

4\. Implement a heuristic function to optimize each agent's path.

5\. Display each agent's final path and the total number of steps taken.

Input:

1\. Grid layout (Start & Goal positions for each agent).

2\. Number of agents (at least 3).

Output:

1\. Collision-free paths for all agents.

2\. Total steps taken by each agent.

3\. Visualization of agent movements on the grid.

Bonus:

Optimize for minimal travel time for all agents collectively.
